\title{Add more permuted genes for differential testing of the distribution measurements between two cell populations}
\usage{
deTest.more(descend.multipop.output, deTest.output, de.pair.names,
  count.matrix, labels, N.more.genes = 10000,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), n.cores = 1,
  cl = NULL, type = "FORK", verbose = T, show.message = T,
  params = NULL, compare.covariates = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{descend.multipop.output}{the returned value of \code{\link{descendMultiPop}}}

\item{deTest.output}{returned values of \code{\link{deTest}} or \code{\link{deTest.more}}}

\item{de.pair.names}{a vector of length 2 showing the two cell population names for differential testing. The names should match the values in \code{labels}}

\item{count.matrix}{the observed UMI count matrix. It should be an R object of class \code{matrix} or \code{dgeMatrix}. Each row is a gene and each column is a cell. The column sums (which should be the library sizes) are used as the input for \code{scaling.consts} when both \code{ercc.matrix} and \code{scaling.consts} are NULL.}

\item{labels}{a vector of factors or characters, indicating the cell popluation label of each cell. The length of \code{labels} should be the same as the number of columns of \code{count.matrix}}

\item{N.more.genes}{number of more permuted genes. The larger the value is, the longer it takes and the smaller the minimum p-value can be}

\item{alternative}{the alternative hypotheses for differential testing}

\item{n.cores}{the number of cores used for parallel computing. Default is 1. Used only when parallel computing is done in a single machine. For using multi-machine cores, need to assign \code{cl} explicitly. If \code{verbose} is TRUE, then a separated file is created to store the progress of each slave cores.}

\item{cl}{an object of class "cluster". See more details in \code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}}}

\item{type}{Default is "FORK" to save memory. Change it to "PSOCK" if you are using Windows and cl is NULL. More details see \code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}}}

\item{verbose}{verbose the estimation and testing procedures or not. Default is True.}

\item{show.message}{whether show messages for the computing progresses. Default is TRUE}

\item{params}{by default, it is descend.multipop.output$params, but users can provide their own in special cases}

\item{compare.covariates}{whether also perform differential testing on the coefficients of the covaraites \code{Z} and \code{Z0}. Need to set to FALSE if the number of covariates is not the same in the two cell populations}
}
\value{
same as \code{\link{deTest}}
}
\description{
The minimum possible p-value is limited by the number of permuted genes used. This function can add more permuted genes to the previous result to get smaller p-values. For examples, see \code{\link{descendMultiPop}}
